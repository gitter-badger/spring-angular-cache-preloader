# spring-angular-cache-preloader
Component to pre-fill caches for angular js rest request though index page

# Project goal

The plan is to develop a component that can be hooked into a Spring WebMVC application to tunnel REST requests that a single page app makes on first page load through the index page and prefill angular's $http cache with the values.

TODO update documentation
